# Fertilizers Recommendation System For Disease Prediction 

# Problem Statement : 

         1. The major problems that the farmers of our country are currently facing includes Crop Failure, Lack of adequate knowledge, Crop damage due to ignorance/carelessness, Lack of professional assistance, Inaccessibility to agro-tech solutions.
         2. We help them by the following aids We will develop a device that will examine the quality of soil and can also detect crop diseases on scanning the leaves of the crops.
         3. Farmers conventional methods of agricultural cultivation are ineffective. It does not make proper use of all available resources. Farmers are unable to detect crop diseases due to a lack of knowledge and old practices, which often result in soil nutrient deterioration and exhaustion.
         4. As a result, crop failure occurs. Growing only certain crops depletes the soil, and if the crops are harmed by illnesses, farmers are uninformed of how to recover such crops.
         5. Food needs cannot be met until and unless efficient resource management and use is implemented.

# PROJECT IDEA : 

Farming is one of the major sectors that influences a country’s economic growth.

In country like India, majority of the population is dependent on agriculture for their livelihood. Many new technologies, such as Machine Learning and Deep Learning, are being implemented into agriculture so that it is easier for farmers to grow and maximize their yield.

In this project, I present a website in which the following applications are implemented; Crop recommendation, Fertilizer recommendation and Plant disease prediction, respectively.

In the crop recommendation application, the user can provide the soil data from their side and the application will predict which crop should the user grow.

For the fertilizer recommendation application, the user can input the soil data and the type of crop they are growing, and the application will predict what the soil lacks or has excess of and will recommend improvements.

For the last application, that is the plant disease prediction application, the user can input an image of a diseased plant leaf, and the application will predict what disease it is and will also give a little background about the disease and suggestions to cure it.

# DISCLAIMER ⚠️

This is a Prototype kind-of project. This project presents the idea that how we can use ML/DL into farming.
